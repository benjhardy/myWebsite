          I had an interesting conversation with my grandmother the other day. She is 79 and almost died last week from some heart complications. I saw her this past Tuesday and after hanging out some, she pulled me aside and said "now Benny I feel like sometimes you feel like you can't say what you mean around me." I noticed her frustration earlier on the phone with me. I was trying to explain something but got caught up in the details and didn't really feel like explaining. I also have sensed she has experienced some mental decline in her later days so I've dumbed down how I talk to her. She clearly has noticed. She's very quick-witted for her age and this time visiting I didn't sense any mental decline in our conversation and she was debateably more quick-witted than I have ever experienced. 
          On a related note, I watched a youtube video yesterday of a Physics PhD student Andrew Dotson. He video blogs about his experience at NMSU. He was explaining his study methods for his 8 hour qualifying exam (lucky me, if you know you know). He was talking about how in the classical portion of his study methods he was beating the lagrangian to pulp in order to bend it for as many problems as possible, he brought up force and potentials got into some pretty advanced hand waiving. The entire comment section was filled with comments like "I'm a music theorist, and know nothing about physics, but I'm still here. "
          I think both of these stories communicate something profound, humans are voraciously curious and we don't care if some of the information is lost in the translation, those of us that are applied and unafraid are ready to embrace the complexity mostly because we find it curiously interesting. My grandma wants me to talk to her as I would talk to anyone else. She loves cross-word puzzles, sudoko, and many other games. She's always playing them in her free time. She's probably the best Scrabble player in my family. She's also wickedly good at trivia games like jeopardy. She clearly enjoys the playground of the mind!
          Take Long-form podcasting. The most popular podcast of all time may be the Joe Rogan Experience. Joe brings on the biggest most expert-like people on the podcast and asks them average joe questions for 3 hours cause he's curious. I think people crave this kind of complexity in everyday life. The internet has provided it in exchange for our attention spans. But I think this wide-encompassing curiousity is being capitalized in so many ways. Podcasts are at an all time high. I don't think we have any reason to see them decline in popularity. I think they will continue to grow. If I could buy stock in podcasts, I would right now. People are listening more than ever, and there is more content for unique subgroups of people than ever before. This is the catch I think, finding podcasts that suit to very particular audiences that make up a large group of people. this will continue to happen.
          But that is just one example. As information becomes more and more widespread, we must adapt our definition of what it truly means to be educated in one particular discipline, this is part of the reason why so many universities are no longer adopting 8 hour qualifying exams (oops I said it).
          similar to what i've been writing about before, the news or simply any kind of mainstream social media is extremely dissatisfying to those that are curious. People are frustrated because they are hearing ideas on 3rd grade reading level. People are ready for the nuance and ready to be spoken to like adults. 
          Another great example of this erupting in culture is Discord, originally a gaming social platform, I know of communities bonding over a common goal or interest and digressing in very particular detail-ridden forums. I guess this has always been one of the most popular types of community on the internet (i.e. reddit and the thing that slack ripped off of). Hell, CERN was the first to use the internet and guarenteed 99/100 people reading this (if anyone does) wouldn't have been able to retain even 1% of the contents that people probably communicated over the first few years of the internet in research related exchanges.  
          Bottom line, there are many non-experts out there that love tending the garden of their mind and embracing that curiousity. This is a huge audience of people that may not have fit into the academic mold,  that may be working seemingly monotonous jobs. I think we more often underestimate the layman's intelligence than overestimate it. You also hear this with children, parents are frequently surprised at how smart their children are if they are paying them close attention. For the betterment of the world I think it is beneficial to inform people it is ok to not know everything that is being communicated, but also to keep a larger degree of complexity trusting questions will be asked to clarify the system of thought or resolve any descrepancy.

          I saw a video of a ferrofluid clock?!?! Some swedish uni bros programmed a system to drag magnets around to make a clock with the fluid as the characters! was really cool, I've always liked ferrofuid, 
          and thought it would be a really cool project if I had the time to do something similar.

          Turns out its completely open source.
          Definitely had the idea that this would be super lucrative as a business idea if someone tried to sell these displays. 
          but then I find its open source haha. The future is feeling bad for trying to monetize something someone else came up with but then they tell you to go ahead.

          I signed up for skillshare. free trial will end august 8th
          Can learn about the stock market with it. Is this the future of education? Not sure how much I believe in the college system anymore.

          The need for nuance in society.
          While listening to an Eric Weinstein Portal Podcast episode with Ross Douthat I began thinking when Eric listed a whole plethora of areas of thinking were there is extreme polarization present online. 
          Vaccinations, religion vs science, evolution vs creation, blue vs red, pro-choice vs pro-life, free-speech etc. We often give simple explanations to children to either shut them up or simply satisfy their curiousity. 
          Whether we are annoyed, or we have in our western thinking biased knowledge over uncertainty, the result is either 2 outcomes in the child's mind. They accept the explanation and every experience related to the topic thus needs to fit the explanation or logical cascade. 
          Or the child can question this explanation and poke holes in it as an assertion or absolute statement. 
          So often in everday life, an open-explanation or an explanation that allows for the unknown would be considered less than optimal. 
          My favorite example of this bias is the classroom, being 24 years old and a 3rd year graduate student, the past 7-8 years of my education, I have noticed a striking fact in many STEM classes. 
          Questions are never asked. I first noticed this when I started classes at Vanderbilt University. I believe there is a bias towards knowledge specifically at the university, where it is considered more honorable to know what you know rather than knowing what you dont know. 
          In essence there needs to be a bias towards knowing in the classroom in order to reach explanation and logical fluidity and to continue ideas in the minds of the students. 
          However, there is a voracious disrespect in the student towards the unknown, an uncomfortable feeling when the professor doesnt know the answer. 
          There is a therefore incentive to not ask hard questions, and it is rare in my experience for there to be any hard questions asked in a class and those including myself who might ask questions are left to feel ostracized and like they are attacking the professor especially when the professor moves to the defensive position.

          But this brings me to Nassim Nicholas Taleb's idea of Platonicity. Platonicity "...is our tendency to mistake the map for the territory, to focus on pure and well-defined 'forms,' whether objects, like triangles, or social notions, like utopias (societies built according to some blueprint of what 'makes sense'), even nationalities. When these ideas and crisp constructs inhabit our minds, we privilege them over other less elegant objects, those with messier and less tractable structures... Platonicity is what makes us think we understand more than we actually do." (The Black Swan, page xxx, Nassim Nicholas Taleb)
          Taleb goes on to explain that this is where things get dangerous and the so-called "Black Swan" can emerge amidst the platonic fold where the territory is much different than the map realizes in a very specific context, something like an exception that hasnt been conceived.
        </h3>
        <h3>
          Perhaps in our western thinking we are hard-wired to value knowledge just because it is easier, or maybe every human is uncomfortable with the unknown. But to totally ignore the unknown and areas of uncertainty in our own understanding would be blasphemy to the beauty of knowledge itself as only innovative and new knowledge structures are built upon the assumption that past representations missed something. The unknown is uncomfortable, but must be respected, and the emotions it evokes must also be entertained, as when we sit and acknowledge and are even taught by the unknown innovation and newness is right around the corner. Amusement with the limits of current explanation or understanding, is curiousity and is the foundation of science. As a scientist myself, sitting in this place of unknown and respecting it and entertaining it, I believe innovation and discovery lurks at this edge or the "platonic fold". To assume there is no room for nuance or the unknown in often too politically based discussions, humans rights decisions, and beliefs, is to assume the the tip of the iceberg is all that matters because it is what can be seen.
          As society digresses into non-conversations and idealogical viewpoints with simple yes and no dichotomous explanations of the world, we lose nuance and thus the possiblity to actually take steps forward avoiding stagnation and deadend discussions.
