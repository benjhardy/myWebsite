    <h2>1. On the requirements for a 'complete' dense transmission coil array for brain imaging at 7T</h2>
    <h3>
      I am simulating surface loops of different radius and number on a fixed cylinder ignoring coupling in order to determine the tradeoff between homogeniety and element number.
      The project aims to target an optimal number of Tx elements and build a dense coil array with RF shimming capabilities. The project also focuses finding an array that performs well across a patient population 
      rather than 1 model or generic models acceptable for safety measurements.

     <h4>
       Figure 1: Simulated dense arrays shimmed over the Visible Human Project 1mm {x,y,z} resolution head model. The CoV (%) is the standard deviation of magnitude of the B1+ across the brain 
       divided by the mean of |B1+|. The maximum shim amplitude is the maximum A of the complex A*e^(i*theta) of the N (where N is the number of coils) shim weights.
       A choice 256 element array can outperform a 480 element array when placed closer to the head (26.4 cm vs  26.4 cm diameter ). 
       The 480 element array was sub-sampled over each column and row to show the efficiency loss of lower element coils.

    <h2>2. Defining intersubject variability: Safety and pulse sequence design differences across a large population in silico </h2>
    <h3>
      Most systems rely on a safety factor {...really a fudge factor} that estimates Specific Absorption Rate for a patient in the scanner based on a generic model. A generic model is used since it is time consuming
      to generate accurate models of patients and mapping the electric field let alone the B1+ field across anyone placed in the scanner. Currently, my group is generating a large library of accurately segmented 
      head models. Using these head models and commonly used coil designs in the commercially available software XFdtd (REMCOM). The differences in calculated SAR and B1+ sensitivity maps may be charecterized across a realistic
      population of subjects. Along with this, questions concerning SARs correlation with relatively highly conductive CSF content or any other tissue in the head can be answered.

    <h4>
      Figure 2: Rotating 20 head models within a coil 3 times for 60 data points. Each rotation was randomly selected between 0 and 5 degrees towards z+ or z-. 
      Rotation of 5 degrees can change shim performance.
      Some Heads are cheaper to shim than others.
      Optimized shims up to 3% variability in CoV.
      Max current/element could vary by a factor of 2 between subjects.
